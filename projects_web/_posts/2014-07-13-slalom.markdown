preamble: Bridges cassowary and touch interaction with physics simulation.
description: Many touch interactions involve the user's dragging a visual object such as a panel, a photo, an icon, a window or any other structural element of the user interface (and the object's moving synchronously under the touch point) and imparting momentum to that object, such that when released the object keeps moving with some momentum. The touch handler that you write will impose some constraints on how and where an object can move, such as constricting it to a single axis and clamping the distance it can travel. If you're implementing a complex interaction, then every time you iterate your idea and want to change something, you have to rewrite a lot of manual, very detailed code. What if we came up with a system where we just specify how something moves and what the constraints are?
