description: AutoLayout.js implements Apple's Auto Layout constraint system and Visual Format Language in Javascript. Auto layout is a system which lets you perform lay out using mathematical relationships. It is based on the incremental cassowary constraint solving toolkit and uses the awesome Cassowary.js library. AutoLayout.js provides a simple API and programming model for integrating auto layout and VFL into other Javascript technologies, as well as an editor for creating layouts using (E)VFL.
