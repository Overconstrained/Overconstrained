description: Emeus is a pure C99 implementation of the Cassowary constraint solver, and it provides a container and layout manager based on Auto Layout rules for applications written using the GTK+ GUI toolkit. Additionally, it provides a Visual Format Language parser for generating the constraints for the layout.
